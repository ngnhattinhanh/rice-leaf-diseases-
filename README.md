# 🌾 Classification of Common Rice Diseases Using Deep Learning Models

## 📌 Introduction
This is a graduation thesis applying **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning** to identify and segment disease areas on rice leaves through images, aiming to support early diagnosis and smart agriculture. The project employs two state-of-the-art models:

- **YOLOv8-seg** by Ultralytics
- **Mask R-CNN** by Detectron2 (Facebook AI Research)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an image dataset of 4 common rice diseases:
  - Rice blast
  - Bacterial leaf blight
  - Organic toxicity
  - Grain discoloration
- Apply deep learning models to accurately segment disease-affected regions on rice plant images.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, IoU, and mAP.

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries Used
- Programming language: **Python**
- Deep learning framework: **PyTorch**
- Training environment: **Kaggle Notebooks**
- Data processing tool: **Roboflow**
- Models:
  - YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
  - Mask R-CNN (Detectron2)
- Dataset: Collected from two real rice fields in An Giang Province, Vietnam.

## 📊 Experimental Results
- **YOLOv8-seg**: Faster inference speed, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Mask R-CNN**: Higher segmentation quality, but slower.
- Both models struggled with class imbalance and small object detection.

## 🧠 Future Development
- Improve class balance in the training data.
- Apply lightweight models for mobile or embedded devices.
- Develop real-time rice disease monitoring systems in the field.
